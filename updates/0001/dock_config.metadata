name:Configure Ubuntu dock
Configures the Ubuntu GNOME dock according to personal preference: 

- Positioned at the bottom of the screen
- Icon size: 26
- Icons centered
- Auto-hide off
- Use whole screen width (instead of a floating panel)
- Don't show mounts

I find this style works well for virtual machines running in VMWare Workstation (not in full screen mode), where having additional screen width is a benefit.
